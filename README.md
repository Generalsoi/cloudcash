## Overview

This is a fintech dummy application that I built using react.js, tailwindCSS and firebase. It allows for users to be able to
signup or register using an email and password, and then be redirected to a dashboard where their registered email address would be
displayed at the top right corner of the desktop screen or at the top left corner of the mobile screen. It also allows for users to be
automatically logged in whenever they revisit the site after previously signing up. Users can also login using their gmail accounts directly.
