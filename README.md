## Overview

This is a love calculator that I built using react.js, and tailwindCSS. It allows for users to be able to
enter two names: the first being their name, and the second being the name of their crush or supposed lover,
and then on clicking the "calculator icon", the application would calculate the love percentage between the
two individuals, and return a value, with a message.
